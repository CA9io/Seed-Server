# Torrent Seed Server

## What is this about?
This project helps users of CA9.io Metaverse to keep their files and addons permanently available. Since we use a torrent protocol [Webtorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) for data exchange, especially smaller projects and addons need a seed server that is permanently online to make sure that the files are always available.
